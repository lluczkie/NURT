## About this project
(Under developement)
This ROS2 project is an early stage visualization of a NURT project under scientific club TAPIR at Faculty of Electrical Engineering at Warsaw University of Technology. We aim to construct a robot that finds glasses within it's workspace and fills them with a drink of choice. Visualization helps understand robot's desired behavior.
